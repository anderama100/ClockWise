# ClockWise
## Perform an integrated management of day-to-day activities 


"ClockWise" is a personalized agenda in which any user 
can register and access to create tasks that can display the calendar.

It was developed with MERN technology and the JWT authentication [link](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

**MERN** is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS,
and NodeJS as its working components. Here are the details of what each of these
components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

- MongoDB: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.
- NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a 
           machine rather than in a browser.
- ExpressJS: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of 
            a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not 
            developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine,  
            ExpressJS was developed.
- ReactJS: A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that 
           create the user interface of the single page web application.

**JWT**(JSON Web Token) is an open standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
for securely transmitting information.

JWTs can be encrypted to provide secrecy between parties through signed tokens.

Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, 
while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. 
When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also 
certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.
